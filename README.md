## Explanation:

`HTML`:

* The HTML structure includes a container with a heading, a dad joke display area, copy and share buttons, and a message display.
* It loads external styles and scripts for animation and font icons.
* The page is centered and has a background image.

`CSS`:

* The CSS provides styling for the page, including fonts, colors, button effects, and responsiveness.
* It uses animations and background effects for a visually appealing design.

`JavaScript (JS)`:

* The JS code handles fetching dad jokes from an API and displaying them.
* It provides functionality to copy jokes to the clipboard and share them (if supported by the browser).
* The "Get Joke" button updates the displayed joke with a delay.
* The code uses the Clipboard API to copy text and the Web Share API for sharing.
* A message is displayed briefly when the joke is copied.

Overall, this code creates an interactive dad joke generator that allows users to enjoy jokes and share them with others.
